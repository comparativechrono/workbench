# Expandable native tool library

## Released 0.11.0, 2026-10-08

[Version 0.11.0 is published](https://github.com/comparativechrono/workbench/releases/tag/app-v0.11.0) as a development
prerelease. It provides both a standalone Starter and a validated updater from
0.10.1. [PR #6](https://github.com/comparativechrono/workbench/pull/6) merged at
`a97af2d02a3a6f4623ceec0f06f69fa10d04cbb6`; the packaged application remains source
`acfa060c9a400d82509278b657ee37853c7922b0`.

Final native gates passed 7 library, 32 workspace, 8 References, 9 results,
3 scrolling panel groups and 13 upgrade checks per ordinary/space-containing
Windows path. Each upgrade preserved 204 existing files and verified 72 core
files. Live Ensembl downloads were rerun. Publication and an independent second
download verified all eleven public assets, their checksum manifests and ZIPs.

The [release summary](evidence/tool-library-0.11.0-release-summary.json),
[acceptance lock](evidence/tool-library-0.11.0-release-lock.json),
[publication record](evidence/tool-library-0.11.0-publication-2026-10-08.json) and
[public audit](evidence/tool-library-0.11.0-public-downloads-2026-10-08.json)
supersede the original pending acceptance/updater/publication statements below.
Those statements are retained as dated development history. See the
[0.11.0 notes](../docs/releases/0.11.0.md) for installation, update instructions,
failed helper attempts and validation limits.

## Original development handover, 2026-10-07

Development started **2026-10-07** from published 0.10.1 documentation baseline
`3a6e06f8fa05a8ceebed4584bd3433e07f08df52`, on
`feature/expandable-tool-library`. The tested development candidate is **0.11.0**.
Published 0.10.1 and its independent tool packs remain unchanged. This page is
a development handover with exact-package Windows evidence, not release or
tester acceptance. Implementation and validation are ready for tester review
in [PR #6](https://github.com/comparativechrono/workbench/pull/6).

## Requested interaction

Testers asked to replace the category dropdown and flat scrolling tool list
with visible category headings that expand to show their tools, as in Galaxy.
The official Galaxy Training Network
[interface tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.html)
(last modified 2026-09-23) and its
[interface image](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/images/galaxy_interface.png)
were inspected on 2026-10-07. The image itself shows a 2025 event banner; its
page's modification date is not evidence that the screenshot was captured in
2026. The design reference is search above browsable tool sections. Workbench
retains its own native controls, styling, branding and general-settings pane.
No Galaxy images, code or other assets are included in the application.

## Native implementation

`desktop/desktop_workspace.cpp` uses a Windows TreeView for tool library control
104. Category headings come from the installed catalogue and contain tool
children with the existing scientific display names. Categories are navigation
items, never executable tools or workflow inputs. Multiple categories may be
open at once. The category dropdown is removed, giving the library more space.

Single-click a heading to expand or collapse it. Native arrow-key navigation
and Enter/Space on a heading provide keyboard access. Selecting a tool opens
its standalone form in Tools mode. In Workflow mode, Add to workflow,
double-click and dragging a tool onto the canvas keep their existing meanings.
Expanding a heading must never add a step or replace the current form.

Search includes category names and existing tool search metadata. Search and
the existing compatible-output filter reveal matching tools inside their
categories. Clearing a filter restores the ordinary browsing expansion state.
Expansion, selection and viewport are session presentation state, separate from
saved scientific workflows and exact pack pins. Routine model refreshes should
not rebuild an unchanged tree or reset the user's browsing position. Installing
a pack supplies new tool/category metadata without an application rebuild.

## Validation and candidate status

The native implementation is complete and has passed a strict-warning
cross-build with the pinned LLVM-MinGW 20260922 UCRT compiler. The Linux source
gate passed **70 tests, no failures or skips** across desktop host (12), modes
(11), workflow inputs (11), pack service (6), setup manager (15), setup service
(7) and split packaging (8). Independent review found and corrected a Win32
expansion-notification issue: repeated toggles can omit notifications after
`TVIS_EXPANDEDONCE`, so the view now records actual expansion state directly.
These source/build findings are separate from the exact packaged Windows checks
below. No tester acceptance, public release or updater is claimed yet.

The candidate workflow is `.github/workflows/native-tool-library-candidate.yml`.
It builds a standalone Windows starter and matching source once, then tests
those exact bytes in ordinary and space-containing installation paths. Existing
workspace checks retain their real starter analysis and workflow interactions;
the focused library gate covers category navigation and filtering. Gate code
must read control 104 as a TreeView without changing unrelated ListView tests.

The frozen candidate was built from
`acfa060c9a400d82509278b657ee37853c7922b0` in
[run 37678010251](https://github.com/comparativechrono/workbench/actions/runs/37678010251).
Its existing workspace gate passed **32 checks in each Windows path**, including
actual tool dragging, compatible port connections and the native minimap2 to
SAMtools chain preserving all 202 expected alignment records. The first focused
library gate stopped at its initial collapsed-heading assertion in both paths;
the run as a whole therefore failed. Those results are retained, not counted as
focused-library passes.

The helper had treated any nonzero TreeView state as expanded. Final raw state
inspection returned `16` (`TVIS_BOLD`) for every initial category, with the
`32` (`TVIS_EXPANDED`) bit absent. The corrected helper masks that bit and
cross-checks it against independently retrieved item state. The verification-only
workflow downloads the same frozen starter, checks its SHA-256 and uses fresh
extractions. It does not rebuild the application.

[Run 37678715894](https://github.com/comparativechrono/workbench/actions/runs/37678715894),
using validator commit `3c2d5079355e6a056dcdbe39f25b7b7bead7d670`, passed
**all six focused category checks in each Windows path, with no skips**. These
cover collapsed headings, pointer and keyboard expansion, search and restoration,
standalone form selection, distinct workflow selection/add/double-click/drag
behavior, and an actual offline pack import supplying a new category. The last
case uses a synthetic pack, not a new published scientific tool.

Independent static audit passed **26 grouped checks**: all 72 core inventory
entries, 602 source files matched to the exact Git commit, all 143 Starter pack
files unchanged from published 0.10.1, and unchanged production profile/trust.
The [validation record](evidence/tool-library-0.11.0-validation-2026-10-07.json)
binds native reports, screenshots and archives. The
[static audit](evidence/tool-library-0.11.0-static-audit-2026-10-07.json) has its
own narrower scope. Creation-time pending status inside immutable build/source
companions is superseded by these records; do not rewrite those archives.

## Tester download and remaining release work

Download the
[standalone Windows candidate](https://github.com/comparativechrono/workbench/actions/runs/37678010251/artifacts/11507651323)
while signed into GitHub. Extract the artifact, then extract its inner
`native-workbench-0.11.0-starter-windows.zip` into a separate test folder and run
`NativeWorkbench.exe`. No older installation is required. The artifact is
retained until 2026-11-06; it is not a permanent release download.

The inner Starter archive is **17,044,022 bytes**, SHA-256
`e816e2f7cd5efe98af752fbf072fab00344ebaa2b6963795c2fbf4a86b5fa81c`.
The matching source archive is **46,875,983 bytes**, SHA-256
`a45ad640f0767bb56458b59ce50d263537e54ebb401a0e809f31a5453adb2f2b`.
Both are retained by the candidate workflow. Keep the original application
source and separate validator identities when recording later acceptance.

Before a release, obtain tester acceptance, build and validate an updater from
the supported published baseline, and follow the established exact-artifact
promotion/public-download workflow. Do not overlay this Starter onto an existing
installation or present the candidate as an already validated upgrade.

Live Full downloads, Ensembl downloads and upgrades are outside this layout
change's candidate gate. Prior passes for those features apply only to their
recorded artifacts. This UI work does not resolve the separate tester-machine
bridge/security investigation or establish managed-PC approval.
Native captures were at 96 DPI; finite hosted screenshots do not establish
physical-display flicker behavior, touchpad interaction or high-DPI acceptance.
