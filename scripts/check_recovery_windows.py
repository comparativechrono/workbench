"""Exact-package Windows recovery, resource admission and project gate.

Core checks use the untouched extracted application and its private interpreter.
The abrupt-termination case uses a separate extraction with a labelled callback
barrier, restores the original service bytes, then restarts the unmodified app.
Synthetic execution intervals establish admission behavior, never benchmarking.
